# url-shortener
## Simple app used for creating short URLs. 

First you need to run main.py, then head to displayed address (or enter http://127.0.0.1:5000 directly in your browser).

Then you can insert your original link and preffered shortened version of it (or leave it blank for automatically generated one).

On succesfull attemp you can go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/yourShortenedURL** to redirect yourself onto the original website.

<sub>By heading into http://127.0.0.1:5000/cleardb you can clear the database.</sub>
